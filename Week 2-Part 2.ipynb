They have been reporting a high number of car accidents due to varied reasons.So the government of Seattle is in its pursuit of reducing the car collisions that is happening on its roads. The best way to approach this would be to analyze the data that contains details of the previously occured such accidents. \n\nThere is a high need for an algorithm or system that could prevent or initialy atleast flatten the curve of accidents taking place,through its pedictions so that required force is sent for their rescue. Beyond several factors relating to the physical,mental and driving conditions of the people who are on the driver seat, the status of the roads being travelled through, the weather and climatic conditions and other common commodities are also to be taken into account.\n\nThe target audience of the project are the Seattle government, the police department , the rescue groups and the car insurance companies too. This project and its results might open up some statistics for the target audience and make insightful decisions for reducing the number of accidents and injuries on its roads."

PEDCYLCOUNT: The number of bicycles involved in the collision helps identify severity level\n6.  VEHCOUNT: The number of vehicles involved in the collision identify severity level\n7.  JUNCTIONTYPE: Category of junction at which collision took place helps identify where most collisions occur\n8.  WEATHER: A description of the weather conditions during the time of the collision\n9.  ROADCOND: The condition of the road during the collision\n10. LIGHTCOND: The light conditions during the collision\n11. SPEEDING: Whether or not speeding was a factor in the collision (Y/N)\n12.
